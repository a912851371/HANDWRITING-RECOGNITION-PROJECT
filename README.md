# Introduction
The main job for this poject, which is based on python, compiling on PyCharm, is to recognize the user's handwritten digit. Combining with regressional and convolutional function, the users just need to open the main function and the project will run. Linking to HTML file, there is a canvas which user can use mouse to draw.

Users can draw the digit whatever they like in the canvas. Then the browser will response automatically and give you the probability with regression and convolution.Users can also press ```clear``` button to clear their drawing if they are not satisified with it. The feedback is instant and couldn't be saved
